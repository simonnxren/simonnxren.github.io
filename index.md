I completed my undergraduate degreee in Electrical Engineering at UBC. During the study, I have worked as a silicon validation intern at Intel of Canada for a 8-month period. It is the time when I got to know about and interested in machine learning and deep learning.

In 2020, I started my graudate study in Master of Engineering program in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UBC. It is a course-based program. But I got chances to take ML/DL related courses from various areas.
